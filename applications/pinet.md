# PINET – Decentralized Energy Tokenization & Green Asset Infrastructure

## Project Overview
PINET is a cross-chain decentralized energy tokenization and peer-to-peer renewable trading platform.  
It enables users to tokenize solar/wind energy output, trade green energy credits, and automate settlement through smart contracts on Polymesh.

Our goal is to build a regulated-friendly on-chain framework for:
- energy asset tokenization
- green credit issuance
- cross-chain settlement (BNB, Polygon, Avalanche)
- decentralized identity & compliance alignment

Polymesh is an ideal chain for this because of its regulated environment, identity primitives, and on-chain governance.

## Problem Statement
Current renewable energy markets suffer from:
- centralized intermediaries  
- slow settlement cycles  
- opaque REC (renewable energy certificate) processes  
- high verification cost  
- lack of tokenization infrastructure for small producers  

PINET solves this using a Polymesh-aligned, identity-secure, permissioned token layer.

---

## Proposed Solution
### PINET Energy Tokenizer (Component for Polymesh)
A module that enables:
1. **KYC-verified token issuance** for energy units  
2. **Energy Credit Token (ECT) standard** aligned with Polymesh compliance  
3. **Regulated transfers** (permissioned token)  
4. **Green credit mint/burn automation**  
5. **Polymesh-native settlement contracts**

## Grant Category
**Level 1 – up to 10,000 POLYX**  
Scope: Core smart-contract + compliance integration + documentation.

---

## Deliverables (Milestones)

### **Milestone 1 – Energy Token Standard (40%)**
- Smart contract for ECT token (Polymesh-compatible)  
- Mint/burn logic  
- Basic transfer with compliance flags  
- Unit tests + documentation

### **Milestone 2 – Tokenization Module (40%)**
- On-chain asset registration flow  
- Oracle/producer verification stub  
- Compliance integration  
- Demo UI

### **Milestone 3 – Documentation & Deployment (20%)**
- Full documentation  
- Developer guide  
- Deployment on Polymesh testnet  
- Video tutorial

---

## Security
We will integrate external audits before mainnet.  
We also use automated risk-scoring tools (Webacy/DD) during presale and identity checks.

---

## Licensing
Apache 2.0 / MIT — fully open source.

---

## Ecosystem Value
- Provides Polymesh with a new regulated asset class (energy)  
- Enables enterprise adoption (solar farms, microgrids, REC issuers)  
- Adds strong real-world utility

---

## Funding Request
**10,000 POLYX (Level 1)**  
Used for:
- development time  
- contract testing  
- compliance module integration  
- open-source documentation

---

## Expected Completion Timeline
**Full integration completed by March 2026 (Q1 2026).**
